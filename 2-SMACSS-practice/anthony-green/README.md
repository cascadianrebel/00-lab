##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I placed all layout items into the layout.css. Anything involving color or decoration was placed into base.css. Once I confirmed everything still looked the same, I took the more specific elements and put their styling in modules.css. I left the header elements in base because I imagined other pages in the same site would have similar styling. 

The only place I wasn't sure of was the font size. I left font size in base.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring.
